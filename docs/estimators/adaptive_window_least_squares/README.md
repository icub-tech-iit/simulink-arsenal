Adaptive Window Least-Squares Estimators
========================================

These estimators provide first and second order derivatives of the incoming data.
The implementation makes use of a least-squares approach applied to a timboxed adaptable window
and is based on the paper https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/87.880606.
