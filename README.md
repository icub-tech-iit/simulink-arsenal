# How to integrate the `Simulink Arsenal` in your project
To integrate the `Simulink Arsenal` in your project, you can either clone this repository or add it as a submodule.
The latter option is recommended, as it allows you to easily update the `Simulink Arsenal` to the latest version and keep it embedded in your project.
To this end, follow the MathWorks [instructions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/organize-project-into-components-using-submodules.html).

Once you have added the `Simulink Arsenal` to your project, you can start using its components via the Library Browser.
The library is called: **iCub Tech Arsenal**.

> [!note]
> Remember that Git does not clone automatically submodules.
> To achieve this, just yield `git clone <your-project-repo> --recurse-submodules` or `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
